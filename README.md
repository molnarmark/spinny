Spinny is a tiny terminal spinner package for [Nim Programming Language](https://nim-lang.org).
![Spinny in Action](https://github.com/molnarmark/spinny/blob/master/action.gif)

## Getting Started

You can use Nimble to install the package by running:
```
nimble install spinny
```

Feel free to take the [example code](https://github.com/molnarmark/spinny/blob/master/spinny.nim#L112) to test out the package!


## Usage

Spinny is quite easy to use. You can set an already running `Spinny`'s symbol, color, or even the text!

```nim
import spinny, colorize, os

var spinner1 = newSpinny("Loading file..".fgWhite, "dots")
spinner1.setSymbolColor(colorize.fgBlue)
spinner1.start()

# do some work here
for x in countup(5, 10):
  sleep(500)

spinner1.success("File was loaded successfully.")

var spinner2 = newSpinny("Downloading files..".fgBlue, "dots5")
spinner2.setSymbolColor(colorize.fgLightBlue)
spinner2.start()

# do some work here
for x in countup(5, 10):
  sleep(500)

spinner2.error("Sorry, something went wrong during downloading!")
```

You can even use custom spinners, if one of the std aren't suitible for your needs.

```nim
var spinner3 = newSpinny("I'm custom.", @[%* "x", %* "y"])
spinner3.setSymbolColor(colorize.fgGreen)

spinner3.start()

# do some magnificent work here
for x in countup(1, 5):
  sleep(500)

spinner3.success("Looks like it's working!")
```

Spinny uses the [colorize](http://github.com/molnarmark/colorize) library for terminal colors.
For spinners to use, take a look at the [spinners JSON file](https://github.com/molnarmark/spinny/blob/master/spinners.json). (Credit goes to [sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus/cli-spinners))


## API Reference

The following procs are available on a `Spinny` object:

* `setSymbolColor*(spinny: Spinny, color: proc(x: string): string)`
* `setSymbol*(spinny: Spinny, newSymbol: string)`
* `setText*(spinny: Spinny, newSymbol: string)`
* `start*(spinny: Spinny)`
* `stop*(spinny: Spinny)`
* `success*(spinny: Spinny, msg: string)`
* `error*(spinny: Spinny, msg: string)`


## FAQs

### Error with 'Threadpool' when using nimble
If you encounter the following error when running `nimble build`:
```bash
.../.choosenim/toolchains/nim-0.19.0/lib/pure/concurrency/threadpool.nim(13, 10) Error: Threadpool requires --threads:on option.
```

Then try adding the following to your `nim.cfg` file:
```
threads:on
```
